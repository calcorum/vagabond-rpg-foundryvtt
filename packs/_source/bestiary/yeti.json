In kind, the environment also begins evolving in their presence, with some fae hightening its splendor, and others evoking terror. In areas where benevolent fae reside, some say you can hear the wind sing the songs of creation.\nHowever, this wind can turn to a black howl of hate at the fickle whims of these creatures.\b Finding yourself in a fae\u2019s domain without the permission of a fae is no easy task. Intention itself seems to keep mortals out of those realms, leading many to believe only those of pure innocence to the point of naivety can find themselves within a domain. You don\u2019t find the wilds of the fae, they find you.",
