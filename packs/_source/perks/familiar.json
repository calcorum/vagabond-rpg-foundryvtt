It uses your Cast Skill for Checks and Saves, and you can Cast Spells using the familiar as a conduit for your Magic. If you do, you can deliver the Spell from the familiar as if it were originating from you. The familiar is banished when it drops to 0 HP or if you conduct this Ritual again to create another familiar.</p>",
