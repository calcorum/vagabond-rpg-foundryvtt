# Catch-Up Command

Review the project plan, git commmits, and MemoryGraph memories for the current project in order to have sufficient context to continue work on the project.

## Instructions

First, review ../../PROJECT_ROADMAP.json to see what tasks are completed and which are tested.

Second, review the git status. If there are outstanding updates, determine if they are related to a task from the Project Roadmap. Then review recent commits to confirm the Project Roadmap is up to date.

Third, use the MemoryGraph skill to search for "foundry" and "vagabond" memories to see what is most relevant to the current state.
